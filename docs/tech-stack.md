backend
-------

###python
direct http interface?

quick pick: [falcon](https://github.com/falconry/falcon)

###sqlite
    Idea
        name   (<140 char),
        description (<1 page -- <2000 char?)

frontend
--------
Let's pick the widest-used from <http://stateofjs.com/2016>, unless the runner-up has significantly more satisfaction.

### language
javascript ES6

###package manager
yarn

###css
 1. sass ✓

    a less-annoying css syntax, imo

 2. css modules ✗

    Tightly integrated to javascript.
    Doesn't interoperate with python currently, afai can tell.
