Docker Files
============
We want to use docker for the repeatability and portability it provides.
In principle, we should be able to do local development, testing, and production using the *exact* same images.


Principles
----------
    * only use &&-combining when it would reduce the layer size
    * if two uses of the image require different packages, make them different images
    * images put shared requirements in base images
    * using the dev image should be as easy as using the local box
    * speed: Currently, with a warmed docker cache, 'make dev' takes 2.3 seconds
    * anything over one line should be a script that's ADD'ed
    * use the 'ADD image /' pattern for adding files to the image
